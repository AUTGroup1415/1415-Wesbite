<h4>I personally believe cloud storage is the way to go. It allows people and companies to use a 
much more affordable and easy way to store large amounts of data without the hassle of having to 
physically hold the storage devices but as we move more into the future, we will have to develop 
new ways of securing data. As tech develops, malicious threats will become larger and larger. 
There is always a risk with everything but I believe the positives outweigh the negatives with cloud storage. </h4>

<h4>I think that cloud storage has helped many businesses and companies grow into what they are now, 
large-scale global reach companies/businesses. I believe that the risks are almost negligible because 
nowadays everything is covered by fair use and terms of services, so customers and their data can legally 
not be accessed for any reason if it's stated in the storage providers T&Câ€™s. For me, cloud storage has been 
great when sharing documents, files, and pictures with friends and even group members in assignments. 
Every single one of my Uni classes I've either had to share some form of a file with a peer or digitally send it to get graded. 
Without cloud storage, we would be stuck in the dark ages and this is why I believe cloud storage has had one of the 
biggest impacts on technological advancement in the past 20 years. </h4>

<h4>One downside I have with online data storage is that you can't be sure that if you delete a file, it's actually deleted. 
One time I had to reinstall some apps on an android phone and discovered that many old photos I forgot about and thought 
were deleted turned up in my google photos folder. This surprised me because many of these photos were from several 
years ago that I had forgotten about. This goes to show that you can never be sure that something is deleted when you 
upload anything to the internet.</h4>
