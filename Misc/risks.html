<center><h1>Technology Risks</h1></center>


<p>When moving your personal data to the cloud, you always run the risk of your 
  data getting into the wrong hands. According to Tripathi and Mishra (2011) If 
  someone was to find your username and password, then they would have instant 
  access to your online data. Rather if it was stored on a local hard drive, it
  would be much harder for someone online to gain access to. Companies will have 
  to have highly secure systems in order to protect their client’s data from possible 
  data breaches and outages. A big complaint cloud storage providers receive is that 
  they do not offer a backup system and expect the user to own their own backup. This 
  is not the case with all storage providers though.</p>

<p>There is always a possibility when uploading data/user information to the cloud 
  that data loss/leakage can occur (Anthes 2010). Ways this can occur include user 
  error, data override, and third-party malicious activity. Users accidentally deleting 
  data is the highest method of data loss occurring when transferring information between 
  local and cloud storage. This can happen in multiple ways such as not saving backups, 
  accidentally pasting over data, and deleting wrong files. Another way businesses and
  people can lose data through cloud storage is through malicious attacks. In 2017, 
  WannaCry was released into the world by hackers with a malicious intention of encrypting 
  windows users’ data and demanding between $300 and $600usd and even after paying the ransomware 
  did not decrypt peoples data. This ransomware had the biggest impact on the National Health 
  Service, causing around 20,000 appointments to have to be canceled, and left them with $78 
  million dollars in IT damage(. Approximately 230,000 individual computers were affected by 
  WannaCry with a global data loss impact of about $4 billion dollars. This is one limitation 
  of Cloud storage. Whether users saved data to the cloud or not, their data was not protected in 
  this malicious attack, and possibly even infected their main computer with wannacry spreading 
  through data transfer from cloud storage. The risk of uploading your data to the cloud is that 
  you can't be 100% sure that when you go to download the data again, that it has not been tampered 
  with by a third party.</p>
 
<p>Another risk does not come from the storage providers themselves, but the users devices that have 
  access to the storages. Many companies implement a BYOD system that allows workers to bring their
  own device from home to work at work. When a worker accesses the online storage, they are able to 
  take that device home and still be connected to that database. This has many risks such as data leakage. 
  If a worker's device were to be stolen, a lot of confidential and sensitive information could become public.</p>
