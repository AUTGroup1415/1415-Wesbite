<center><h1>Technology Opportunities</h1></center>


<p>As more and more businesses moved onto the cloud, other companies saw an opportunity to provide a cloud service for businesses to use. Companies would pay 
other companies like google or microsoft a subscription fee for storage and services like access to virtual machines, (Azure) SQL database, app building services 
and other billing management tools. One great feature about this is that the plan is very flexible. Businesses can pick what services they exactly need from the cloud 
service providers which can lower the cost. This flexibility option makes these sorts of services available for any business.</p>

<p>According to Aczel et al. (2009), After more and more companies moved to the cloud, employees found that working from home is completely viable and also saw a 
productivity increase. As long as employees had a device and an internet connection, they were able to connect to the company's database and start work almost 
instantly. So online meetings, cloud services and storage became much more commonly used in the workplace.</p>

<p>As cloud security started becoming more common, security was a huge factor to account for. According to Agarwal (2011), when storing your data online you run risks 
of inadvertently giving away personal information, getting malware and viruses or the data stored is used for unauthorized purposes such as advertising. After these 
risks became more apparent more and more jobs arose around cloud security. Mega Businesses like Google or Amazon store so much data that they would need the top of line 
security systems and security employees to protect all of their users' data in the cloud.</p>

<p>As more databases are made for bigger business, more jobs arose around database management and control. As hardware gets used in a database, it can fail overtime 
and will need repair or replacement at some point. If a server does fail, due to a power cut or internal issue and loses data. It will need to be restored from a backup. 
Data will be backed up either on site at another server, or somewhere else in the world in a different database. Once the employees get the server back up and running, 
they will need to restore and back up the data that was lost. Although, most companies will have lots of security and power redundancy like generators to keep the servers 
operating during an emergency. As big companies expand, They will need more employees looking after their servers, which creates new job opportunities. They will have several 
major databases that will need to be constantly monitored and have the data to be restored if necessary.</p>
