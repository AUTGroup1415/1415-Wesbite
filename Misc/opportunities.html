<center><h1>Technology Opportunities</h1></center>


<p>As more and more businesses moved onto the cloud, other companies saw an opportunity to provide a cloud service for businesses to use. Companies would pay 
	other companies like Google or Microsoft a subscription fee for storage and services like access to virtual machines, (Azure) SQL database, app-building 
	services, and other billing management tools. One great feature about this is that the plan is very flexible. Businesses can pick what services they 
	exactly need from the cloud service providers which can lower the cost. This flexibility option makes these sorts of services available for any business. 
	However, normal everyday users can use the cloud storage option for free. Google for example offers 15GB’s free storage on their cloud. Also Microsoft 
	cloud storage service “One Drive” is built into windows. So users can log in to their account through any windows computer and will have full access to 
	their online storage.</p>

<p>According to Aczel et al. (2009), After more and more companies moved to the cloud, employees found that working from home is completely viable and also saw a 
	productivity increase. As long as employees have a device and an internet connection, According to Devasena (2014), they are able to connect to the company's 
	database and could share documents via the cloud storage instantly, start an online meeting and work collaboratively on projects together. Google has very 
	similar services that have proved to be useful not only in the workplace but also in personal use and in education. Especially during the recent COVID-19 
	Pandemic Crisis, Online classes became normal for lots of students who could not go to class. Online tests and services are now proven to be much more 
	useful for education.</p>

<p>As cloud security started becoming more common, security was a huge factor to account for. According to Agarwal (2011), when storing your data online you run risks 
of inadvertently giving away personal information, getting malware and viruses or the data stored is used for unauthorized purposes such as advertising. After these 
risks became more apparent more and more jobs arose around cloud security. Mega Businesses like Google or Amazon store so much data that they would need the top of line 
security systems and security employees to protect all of their users' data in the cloud.</p>

<p>On top of a security job increase, as more databases are made for cloud server housing, more jobs arose around database management, control, and redundancy. 
	Over time as hardware gets used in a database, it can fail and will need repair or replacement at some point. If a server does fail, due to a power cut or 
	internal issue and loses data. Someone will need to restore the data from a backup. Data will be backed up either on-site at a backup server, or somewhere 
	else entirely a different database. Once the employees get the server back up and running, they will need to restore and back up the data that was lost. 
	Although, most companies will have lots of security and power redundancy like generators to keep the servers operating during an emergency. As big companies 
	expand their cloud computing services, they will need more employees looking after their servers. They will have several major databases that will need to 
	be constantly monitored and have the data be restored if necessary. Thousands of more jobs have been made from the cloud over the time it has become normal.  
	Companies like Google and Microsoft have taken in thousands of employees to work in the cloud.</p>
