</ul><p>According to Jansen (2011), Cloud computing allows the industry to utilize an on-demand network access for computing 
services such as networking, software, analytics, and intelligence, to produce more efficient and economical ways of doing tasks. 
Society has seen major benefits to the introduction of cloud computing such as providing flexibility, cost-reduction and almost 
unlimited data storage for anyone. </p>


<p>One of the biggest impacts cloud computing has had on society is people being able to work from home. 
Since more and more companies are moving all of their data to the cloud, This means that any employee can access the data and 
services they need just with an internet connection and work. In recent times, the coronavirus pandemic has proven this to be 
very useful as companies can still operate online without any human interaction. The employees will be allocated a  
Login username and password into the company's database.</p>


<p>As the cloud became more apparent to society, cost savings were too. It became clear that when moving a business to 
	the cloud for storing your data would be financially smart and employees especially would be able to save time 
	and money by utilizing the cloud. As employees have more time to use since working has become so flexible, 
	people can start working even on holiday as long as they have an internet connection. Since cloud plans are 
	so flexible, you only pay for what you need.  A new generation of online businesses became apparent and more 
	jobs became available where employees would work strictly at home. Workers would connect remotely via a cloud 
	connection hosted by whoever the company has paid the subscription with. Once the employee has connected, they 
	will be given a set of tools, services, and data that they can get to work with, all provided by the cloud service.</p>

<p>When storing data on the cloud, There is privacy issues that also come along. You're never sure where your data is stored and if 
someone has access to it. According to () When a company pays for a cloud service for their business, the cloud service providers 
give an option to how they want to protect their. Where they can choose if they fully trust the cloud service provider and won't put
any encryption on their data. Or they can put some encryption on some data, usually customer data for legal regulations ensuring confidentiality. 
Lastly they can put encryption on everything they store. Which means that there is no chance that the cloud provider can see any of 
the information stored on the cloud service.</p>
	
<p>Another impact Cloud computing has had on society is the number of jobs. As cloud computing grew more popular, more and more jobs 
	arose around Cloud Computing. These Jobs would be like Security, server monitor/repairers, data loss prevention, and more. 
	Bigger companies like Google will now have thousands of employees all over the world working in the cloud to keep it a safe 
	and stable environment for thousands of businesses who use it every day for work. Cloud Computing has also acted negatively
	on Jobs as well. According to Rad et al. (2017),  employees who work in advertising or technical engineers are going to be 
	forced to do certain work with the cloud service providers as more companies join the cloud. Since everything is becoming more 
	automated. The cloud reduces the need for people to manage workloads, security, and contracts as these are all now automated 
	by the cloud service providers.</p>
