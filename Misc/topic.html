</ul><p>According to Jansen (2011), Cloud computing allows the industry to utilize an on-demand network access for computing 
services such as networking, software, analytics, and intelligence, to produce more efficient and economical ways of doing tasks. 
Society has seen major benefits to the introduction of cloud computing such as providing flexibility, cost-reduction and almost 
unlimited data storage for anyone. </p>


<p>One of the biggest impacts cloud computing has had on society is people being able to work from home. 
Since more and more companies are moving all of their data to the cloud, This means that any employee can access the data and 
services they need just with an internet connection and work. In recent times, the coronavirus pandemic has proven this to be 
very useful as companies can still operate online without any human interaction. The employees will be allocated a  
Login username and password into the company's database.</p>


<p>As the cloud became more apparent to society, cost savings were too. It became clear that when moving a business to the cloud 
for storing your data would be financially smart and employees especially would be able to save time and money by utilizing the cloud. 
As employees have more time to use since working has become so flexible, people can start working even on holiday as long as they have 
an internet connection. A new generation of Online businesses became apparent and more jobs became available where employees would work 
strictly at home.</p>

<p>When storing data on the cloud, There is privacy issues that also come along. You're never sure where your data is stored and if 
someone has access to it. According to () When a company pays for a cloud service for their business, the cloud service providers 
give an option to how they want to protect their. Where they can choose if they fully trust the cloud service provider and won't put
any encryption on their data. Or they can put some encryption on some data, usually customer data for legal regulations ensuring confidentiality. 
Lastly they can put encryption on everything they store. Which means that there is no chance that the cloud provider can see any of 
the information stored on the cloud service.</p>
