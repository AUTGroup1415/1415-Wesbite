<h1>Matthew's Ethical Reflection </h1><br>

<h4>I believe that the cloud has its risks and benefits. But I think the benefits outway the risks
  for cloud computing. Using the cloud to store all of my University work and work on has just been 
  so beneficial for me and my learning. Being able to store everything in one place and never worry 
  about losing a USB stick or forgetting to bring it one day.</h4>

<h4>One ethical issue I disagree with is whether the Cloud Service Provider can utilize the data for 
  targeted advertisements. This unauthorized usage of data can cause serious problems, especially in 
  a business environment where they could be storing highly sensitive data and want no one but themselves 
  to have access to it.</h4>

<h4>Another point I disagree with is that there is a lack of control over the data when it is put in the 
  cloud. Most users won’t be able to have control over the permissions of the data or have any decision 
  on where it is stored. So who knows where your data is stored or if an algorithm is looking at it to 
  give you targeted advertisements on what is in your cloud storage. When you don't have full control 
  over your data, there are lots of questions to be asked about it. Like if you delete some of your data 
  from the cloud. How do you know for sure that it has been 100% deleted? What if they have some sort of 
  process where they can hold onto your file which might be some sensitive data. Cloud Service Providers 
  need to be more open about how they store their customer’s data as this is a privacy issue.</h4>

<h4>I would recommend people and especially businesses who utilize the cloud to look for a cloud service 
  provider who can offer an encrypted cloud service/storage system. This means that any data that is 
  stored in the cloud from the user or business, will be encrypted so the owner of that piece of data will 
  only have access to it. This means you won't have to worry about anything or anyone peeking at your 
  sensitive information while storing it on the cloud.</h4>

<h4>Not only is your data at risk from the cloud providers, but also from hackers. Your data on the 
  cloud could be as easy as one password away in some cases. So I would suggest getting a secure password 
  that's not used on any other accounts/login, using letters, numbers, and symbols. After this, I would highly 
  suggest getting 2FA (Two Factor Authentication). This is an extremely secure way to protect your data as 
  when you log in, it will send a text with a unique number you enter to gain access to your cloud account 
  or a prompt will come up on your phone which then asks you to press “yes”. This is the most secure method 
  to be certain that your account is safe. Hackers won’t have your phone or access to it in any way. So these 
  are ideal security measures everyone should take
