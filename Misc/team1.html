<h1>Matthew's Ethical Reflection </h1><br>

<h4>I believe that the cloud has its risks and benefits. But I think the benefits outway the risks for cloud computing. 
Using the cloud to store all of my University work and work on has just been so beneficial for me and my learning. Being 
able to store everything in one place and never worry about losing a USB stick or forgetting to bring it one day.</h4>

<h4>I believe that Cloud Computing has been one of the biggest changes for society and businesses as everything is so much more
convenient and on-demand. One ethical issue I disagree with is whether the Cloud Service Provider can utilize the data for
targeted advertisements. This unauthorized usage of data can cause serious problems, especially in a business environment 
where they could be storing highly sensitive data and want no one but themselves to have access to it.</h4>

<h4>It is also unclear who is responsible for the privacy of the data whether it is the Cloud service providers or the user. 
There is also a lack of control over the data when it is put in the cloud. Most users won’t be able to have control over 
it as they will only be able to store it, there’s no permission control or decision on where it is stored. So who knows 
where your data is stored or if an algorithm is looking at it to give you advertisements based on what is in your cloud 
storage.</h4>

<h4>Another unethical point I also disagree with is not having full control over your data. Lots of people might not think 
about it but if you delete a piece of data from the cloud, how do you know for sure that it’s gone and not stored 
somewhere on their database? Everything is backed up so it must have a copy somewhere. I personally feel that Cloud 
service providers should give more control over user’s data when storing data on the cloud. You should be able to set 
permissions on your data and if you would like it backed up or not.</h4>
